## Overview of the Analysis

* This analysis was used to see how accurately a machine learning model can predict lending outcomes.
* The data used was loan volume, interest rate, income, debt to income, number of accounts, derogatory marks, and total debt
* The machine learning model was created to calculate the likely hood of a default on a high-risk loan.
* To come to this conclusion, I first seperated my independent variable from the rest of the data and then created a training model and test model and compared the results and created a confusion matrix to represent the data.
* Logistic Regression was used to creat a fit model for predictions that could then be compared to the trained model and provide an accurate analysis.

## Results

* Machine Learning Model:
  * The model returned an accuracy score of .99 which is phenomenal and shows that the program was accurate
  * The model had a precision score of 1 and recall score of .99 which resulted in an f1-score of 1




## Summary

Based on the models data and the confusion matrix produced I would highly reccomend using this machine learning model as it not only accurately produces a prediction of what will happen based on the data but also has near perfect precision and recall of the data to make it's predictions.
